boot/ -- Everything required for the boot process
dev/ -- Devices
etc/ -- Configuration files
home/ -- User directories
lib/ --  kernel modules
lost+found/ -- The results of a recovery operation will be placed in this directory
media/ -- mount points for removable media 
mnt/ -- generic mount point under which you mount your filesystems or devices
opt/ -- all the software and add-on packages that are not part of the default installation
proc/ -- virtual filesystem (pseudo-file system). It doesn't contain 'real' files but runtime system information 
root/ -- home directory of the System Administrator, 'root'. 
sbin/ -- 'normal' executables are in bin/ Those used for system maintenance and/or administrative tasks are in sbin/
tmp/ -- files that are required temporarily
usr/ -- user binaries, their documentation, libraries, header files. etc. 
var/ -- variable data like system logging files, mail and printer spool directories

Professor Bear - Linux Users and Groups

sudo passwd www
sudo groupadd dorks
sudo usermod -aG dorks www

sudo mkdir /home/www/html

Professor Bear - Linux Installing Packages Apt

Code for Professor Bear YouTube videos at https://github.com/nikbearbrown

Redhat and Fedora use yum

sudo apt update
sudo apt-get update
sudo aptitude update

apt-get update updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.

apt-get upgrade actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed. This is why you first want to update
Over time, updated versions of packages currently installed on your computer may become available from the package repositories (for example security updates).

sudo apt update        # Fetches the list of available updates
sudo apt upgrade       # Strictly upgrades the current packages
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  # Installs updates (new ones)

apt help

sudo apt-get install wajig 

sudo wajig daily-upgrade  # Perform an update then a dist-upgrade
(it will ask for password if needed, and do all the update, upgrade, dist-upgrade, and autoremove steps for you).

sudo wajig dailyupdate (same as apt-get update apt-get upgrade daily)

wajig new                  (list new packages since last update)

wajig help


less /etc/apt/sources.list

apt-cache search python # To search for a keyword

apt-cache search .  # To get a list of ALL packages

Professor Bear - Linux Processes

ps aux
ps aux | grep ubuntu
pstree
pstree -p

top
kill pid
killall process name (e.g killall python)

python loop.py &

Control-Z and the job will stop the job running at your prompt.

fg pid  foreground

fg 5
Brings the job with the id 5 into the foreground, resuming it if it was suspended.

bg pid  background

bg 5
The stopped job with the id 5 will resume operation, but remain in the background.
