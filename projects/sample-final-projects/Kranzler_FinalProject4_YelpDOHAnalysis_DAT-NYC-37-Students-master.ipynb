This isn't too shocking given that the types of businesses that do disproportionately well on Yelp (as compared to other rating services) are \"hole in the wall\" cheap eats destinations. These restaurants often are dingy on the inside with extremely high volume with very small quarters and often have the same person handling the food and manning the register so there are many risks for contamination.\n",

If the first review on a restaurant's Yelp page is \"I loved my croissant until I realized that it was full of rat shit instead of chocolate; 0 stars\", it's pretty likely others would steer clear and not bother to rate the restaurant themselves.\n",

    "- Additional geographic data: We could research external issues that prevent a restaurant from passing health checks (a subway running under the restaurant, proximity to a waste facility, etc)\n",
    "- Owner / proprietor: It's likely that restaurants in the same restaurant group / chain will have similar codes of cleanliness so we should expect grades to be fairly consistent (see examples below)\n",
    "- Social factors: If employees are treated well they are more likely to care about their place of employment and put their best efforts towards keeping it clean.\n",
    "- Hype / press: Restaurants that are often in the public spot light might be looked on with additional scrutiny. \n",
    "- Etc.: Like any real world dataset, there are infinite numbers of datapoints that could be added. I think we have shown that Yelp star ratings and DOH restaurant grades are not as highly correlated as one might have thought, but I'm sure there are other factors that would be better predictors.\n",
